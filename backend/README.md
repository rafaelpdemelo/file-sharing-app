# Deploy using Minikube

Inside the ```frontend/``` folder and here, you will find several .yaml files. These are responsible for orchestrating and managing the deployment of your application to a Kubernetes cluster, generated by minikube. 

The Deployment files (backend-deployment.yaml / frontend-deployment.yaml) define the specifications for creating Pods and ReplicaSets for the backend and frontend of your application, respectively. A Pod is the smallest unit of compute that can be deployed and managed in Kubernetes, while a ReplicaSet ensures that a specific number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

Service files (backend-service.yaml / frontend-service.yaml) are used to expose your deployments as services within the cluster. A service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

The Ingress file (ingress.yaml) is used to manage external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. 

These files ensure that your application is ready to receive internet traffic as soon as it is exposed by Ingress.
